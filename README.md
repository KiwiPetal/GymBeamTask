# TODO (CRUD) app
A todo app with advanced features. Part of application for a frontend position. 

I will self-host this later, but for now, feel free to fork it.

## Requirements
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager) with (optional) [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install) package manager

## Custom endpoint
In case you want to use your own endpoint, make sure to update the link to it in `./app/utilities/constants.ts`.

For further setup of your endpoint, look at the interface named `Ilist`. It will help you out.

## Setup

- Download all libraries used in the project
```bash
yarn
# or
npm i
```

- To start the website in a development mode, do
```bash
yarn dev
# or
npm run dev
```

- To build and start the website, do
```bash
yarn build && yarn start
# or
npm run build && npm run start
```
